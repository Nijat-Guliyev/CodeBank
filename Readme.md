CodeBank

## Introduction

This is a project representing a bank website. I created it to improve my skills.

## Features and Usage

### Navbar and Smooth Transitions

- At the top of the page, in the header section, there's a navbar with a pleasant and distinct hover effect on the 'a href' links.
- Clicking on these links provides a smooth transition to the respective sections of the page, enhancing user experience.
- On the right, there's an "open account" link. Clicking it opens a form in a pop-up window.
- > **Note:** Due to this being a mid-level project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, advanced form processing is not available.
- Additionally, you'll witness each section smoothly animating upwards as you scroll down.

### "Learn More" Transition

- In the "hero" section, "When banking meets minimalist," there's a "Learn more" button.
- Clicking it smoothly transitions you to the "feature" section.

### Operations Buttons

- The "operations" section contains three distinct buttons.
- Clicking each button displays the corresponding results.

### Slider Navigation

- The "slider" section offers a pleasant, smooth, and elegant visual experience.
- You can navigate the slider left and right using the keyboard's right and left arrow keys, or by clicking the small circular buttons and the left and right arrow icons on the screen.

### Scroll Animations

- Each section animates upwards as you scroll down the page.
- This is a well-designed feature. If you missed it, press "CTRL+R" to refresh the page and observe it again.

## Responsive Design

This website is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes. The following breakpoints are used:

- **1200px (Large Desktops):** Standard desktop layout.
- **992px (Desktops/Laptops):** Adjusted layout for smaller screens.
- **768px (Tablets):** Further adjustments for tablet devices.
- **576px (Mobile Phones):** Optimized layout for mobile devices.

The website adapts its layout and elements to ensure readability and usability on all devices.
